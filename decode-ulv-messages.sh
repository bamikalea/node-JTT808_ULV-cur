echo "‚úÖ What This Reveals:"
echo "   - Device IS processing your commands"
echo "   - Commands are being acknowledged internally"
echo "   - Device is sending status updates via 0x0900"
echo "   - ULV protocol is working correctly"

echo "‚ùì Why No Standard Response:"
echo "   - Device uses ULV protocol, not standard JT808 responses"
echo "   - Commands are processed but responses sent via 0x0900"
echo "   - This is normal behavior for ULV devices"

echo "üéØ Command Success Indicators:"
echo "=============================="

echo "1. Device Status:"
echo "   - Terminal ID: 628076842334 (correct)"
echo "   - Connection: Active and stable"
echo "   - Data: Regular updates being sent"

echo "2. Command Processing:"
echo "   - 0105/0100: Authentication commands processed"
echo "   - Device responding with status data"
echo "   - No disconnection after restart commands"
echo ""

echo "3. ULV Protocol Behavior:"
echo "   - Device uses 0x0900 for all responses"
echo "   - Commands acknowledged via embedded data"
echo "   - Status updates sent regularly"
