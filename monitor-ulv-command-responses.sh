echo "📋 What We're Monitoring For:"
echo "============================"
echo "1. ULV 0x900 messages with command responses"
echo "2. Restart acknowledgment (0x74) in responses"
echo "3. Shutdown/circuit disconnect status (0x72)"
echo "4. Error messages or warnings"
echo "5. Device status changes"

echo "💡 Available Commands:"
echo "====================="
echo "1. 🔄 Resend Restart Command:"
echo "   node resend-ulv-restart.js"
echo ""
echo "2. 🔌 Send Shutdown Command:"
echo "   node send-ulv-shutdown-command.js"
echo ""
echo "3. 🎯 Send Both Commands:"
echo "   node send-ulv-commands.js"

echo "📡 Monitoring Instructions:"
echo "=========================="
echo ""
echo "1. 🚀 Send a command using one of the scripts above"
echo "2. 🔍 Watch your server terminal for:"
echo "   • Command reception logs"
echo "   • ULV 0x900 response messages"
echo "   • Error messages or warnings"
echo "   • Status changes or progress indicators"
echo ""
echo "3. 📊 Key Response Patterns to Look For:"
echo "   • ULV 0x900 messages with embedded commands"
echo "   • Reserved field content showing command status"
echo "   • Device acknowledgment of commands"
echo "   • Progress updates or completion status"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Expected ULV Response Patterns:"
echo "================================="
echo ""
echo "🔄 Restart Command (0x74):"
echo "   • Look for 0x900 messages with 0x74 acknowledgment"
echo "   • Device should report restart progress"
echo "   • Status might change during restart process"
echo ""
echo "🔌 Shutdown Command (0x72):"
echo "   • Look for 0x900 messages with 0x72 acknowledgment"
echo "   • Device should report circuit disconnect status"
echo "   • Connection might be affected"
echo ""

echo "🚨 If Commands Don't Work:"
echo "=========================="
echo ""
echo "1. 🔍 Check for error messages in server logs"
echo "2. 📊 Verify ULV protocol compliance"
echo "3. 🔌 Check device connection status"
echo "4. 📱 Verify terminal ID is correct"
echo "5. ⚡ Check if device supports these commands"

echo "🔍 Real-time Monitoring Tips:"
echo "============================"
echo ""
echo "• Keep your server terminal visible"
echo "• Watch for new log entries after sending commands"
echo "• Look for ULV 0x900 messages with command responses"
echo "• Check for any error messages or warnings"
echo "• Monitor device status changes"
