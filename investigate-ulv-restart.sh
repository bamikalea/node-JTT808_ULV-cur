# Investigate ULV Restart Command Issues
# This script helps diagnose why the device didn't restart despite command acknowledgment

echo "🔍 Investigating ULV Restart Command Issues..."
echo "============================================="
echo ""

echo "📊 Current Situation:"
echo "===================="
echo "✅ Device received restart command (0x8105 + 0x74)"
echo "✅ Device acknowledged command (0x8001 response)"
echo "❌ Device did NOT physically restart"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Possible Issues:"
echo "=================="
echo "1. ULV Protocol Implementation"
echo "2. Command Format or Parameters"
echo "3. Device State or Safety Checks"
echo "4. Missing Additional Commands"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Investigation Steps:"
echo "======================"
echo ""

echo "📋 Step 1: Check ULV Protocol Documentation"
echo "=========================================="
echo "• Verify 0x74 is the correct restart command word"
echo "• Check if additional parameters are required"
echo "• Look for restart prerequisites or conditions"
echo ""

echo "📋 Step 2: Analyze Device Response Patterns"
echo "========================================="
echo "• Monitor ULV 0x900 messages after restart command"
echo "• Look for embedded command status updates"
echo "• Check if device reports restart progress"
echo ""

echo "📋 Step 3: Test Alternative Restart Methods"
echo "=========================================="
echo "• Try different restart command parameters"
echo "• Test shutdown then power-on sequence"
echo "• Check if device needs specific restart mode"
echo ""

echo "📋 Step 4: Check Device State"
echo "============================="
echo "• Verify device is in restartable state"
echo "• Check for pending operations or locks"
echo "• Look for error conditions preventing restart"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Immediate Actions:"
echo "===================="
echo ""

echo "1. 📡 Monitor Server Logs:"
echo "   • Watch for new ULV 0x900 messages"
echo "   • Look for restart-related status updates"
echo "   • Check for error messages or warnings"
echo ""

echo "2. 🔍 Check ULV Protocol Spec:"
echo "   • Review restart command requirements"
echo "   • Verify command word 0x74 is correct"
echo "   • Check for additional parameters needed"
echo ""

echo "3. 🧪 Test Alternative Commands:"
echo "   • Try shutdown command (0x8103)"
echo "   • Test reset command (0x8105 with different parameter)"
echo "   • Check if device needs specific restart sequence"
echo ""

echo "4. 📊 Analyze Device Behavior:"
echo "   • Monitor device response patterns"
echo "   • Check if device reports restart progress"
echo "   • Look for embedded command acknowledgments"
echo ""

echo "💡 Key Questions to Answer:"
echo "=========================="
echo "• Is 0x74 the correct restart command for this ULV device?"
echo "• Are there additional parameters or conditions required?"
echo "• Is the device in a state where restart is allowed?"
echo "• Does the device need a specific restart sequence?"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Next Steps:"
echo "=============="
echo "1. Monitor your server logs for ULV responses"
echo "2. Check ULV protocol documentation for restart requirements"
echo "3. Test alternative restart command formats"
echo "4. Analyze device response patterns for clues"
echo ""

echo "🔍 The device acknowledgment suggests communication is working,"
echo "   but the restart implementation may need adjustment!"
echo "============================================================="
