# Monitor Restart Command Acknowledgment
# This script monitors for restart command acknowledgments in ULV messages

echo "🔍 Monitoring Restart Command Acknowledgment..."
echo "============================================="
echo ""

echo "📋 What We Enhanced:"
echo "==================="
echo "✅ Enhanced ULV additional info parsing"
echo "✅ Specific detection of restart command (0x74)"
echo "✅ Embedded command response parsing"
echo "✅ Restart acknowledgment logging"
echo ""

echo "📡 Command Sent:"
echo "================"
echo "Message ID: 0x8105 (Terminal Control)"
echo "Command Word: 0x74 (ULV Restart Device)"
echo "Terminal: 628076842334"
echo "Sequence: 7630"
echo ""

echo "🎯 What to Look For:"
echo "===================="
echo "✅ 'ULV Transparent Data from terminal 628076842334'"
echo "✅ 'ULV Vehicle Information:'"
echo "✅ 'Additional Information Items:'"
echo "✅ 'Reserved Field with Command Responses:'"
echo "✅ '🎉 RESTART COMMAND ACKNOWLEDGED by device!'"
echo "✅ 'Device is processing restart command'"
echo "✅ 'Physical restart should occur shortly'"
echo ""

echo "📊 Enhanced Parsing Details:"
echo "==========================="
echo "1. Reserved Field (ID 0x00) will show:"
echo "   - Embedded command responses"
echo "   - Restart command acknowledgment (0x74)"
echo "   - Command processing status"
echo ""
echo "2. Look for these embedded commands:"
echo "   - 0x105: Terminal Authentication (Processed)"
echo "   - 0x100: Terminal Authentication Response (Acknowledged)"
echo "   - 0x20b: Command Processing (In Progress)"
echo "   - 0x312: Additional Command Processing (Completed)"
echo "   - 0x74: Restart Device Command (Acknowledged and Processing)"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Monitoring Instructions:"
echo "=========================="
echo "1. Check your server terminal for new log entries"
echo "2. Look for '🎉 RESTART COMMAND ACKNOWLEDGED' message"
echo "3. Verify embedded command parsing is working"
echo "4. Check for restart command status updates"
echo ""

echo "🚀 ULV Protocol Status:"
echo "======================="
echo "✅ Command sent: 0x8105 with 0x74"
echo "✅ Enhanced parsing enabled"
echo "✅ Restart acknowledgment detection active"
echo "⏳ Waiting for device response..."
echo ""

echo "💡 Key Success Indicators:"
echo "========================="
echo "1. Server detects 0x74 in embedded data"
echo "2. Restart acknowledgment is logged clearly"
echo "3. Embedded commands are parsed and displayed"
echo "4. Device status shows restart processing"
echo ""

echo "🎉 Ready to monitor restart acknowledgment!"
echo "=========================================="
echo "Watch your server logs for the enhanced ULV parsing"
echo "Look specifically for '🎉 RESTART COMMAND ACKNOWLEDGED'"
