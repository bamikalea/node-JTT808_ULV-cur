# Vendor Communication Template for ULV Streaming Issues

## Device Information

- **Device Model**: N51
- **Firmware Version**: [Insert firmware version]
- **Terminal ID**: 628076842334
- **Protocol Version**: ULV Network Protocol V2.0.0-2019

## Issue Description

Device successfully acknowledges ULV streaming requests (0x9101) with SUCCESS response (0x0001, result=0x00) but does not establish RTP connection or send video data to the specified server.

## Technical Details

### ‚úÖ What's Working:

1. **JT808 Connection**: Device maintains stable connection to server
2. **Message Handling**: Device correctly receives and parses 0x9101 messages
3. **Protocol Compliance**: Device sends proper 0x0001 response with result=0x00
4. **Network Connectivity**: Device can reach server IP (192.168.100.100)

### ‚ùå What's Not Working:

1. **RTP Connection**: No UDP connection established to port 8000
2. **Video Data**: No RTP packets received with frame header 0x30316364
3. **Streaming**: No video stream initiated after successful handshake

### üìã Streaming Request Details:

```
Message ID: 0x9101 (Real-time audio/video preview request)

TCP Port: 1935
UDP Port: 8000
Channel: 1
Data Type: 0 (Audio+Video)
Stream Type: 0 (Main stream)
```

### üìä Device Response:

```
Message ID: 0x0001 (General response)
Reply ID: 0x9101
Result: 0x00 (SUCCESS)
```

## Questions for Vendor (You)
