echo "   - Commands were sent via TCP to $SERVER_IP:$SERVER_PORT"
echo "   - Server received and processed the commands"

echo "   - Whether terminal processed the commands"
echo "   - Any error messages in server logs"
echo "   - Terminal's response to commands"

echo "2. Look for: command received, terminal response, errors"
echo "3. Verify terminal protocol support for these commands"
echo "4. Check if terminal requires different command format"

echo "üí° Possible Reasons Terminal Didn't Respond:"
echo "   - Commands not in expected format"
echo "   - Terminal doesn't support restart/reset commands"
echo "   - Authentication/authorization issues"
echo "   - Protocol version mismatch"
echo "   - Terminal busy with other operations"
